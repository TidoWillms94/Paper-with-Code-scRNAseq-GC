Analyzing the expression level of LGALS9 (Galectin 9) and HAVCR2 (TIM3) in single-cell RNA sequencing data from gastric cancer patients (blood, paratumor, and tumor tissue).  
# Data avalibility
Single-cell sequencing data (.fastq files) were accessed through the Genome Sequencing Archive from the China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB) under the accession number [HRA000704](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa-human/browse/HRA000704).  
The sequencing data were made public through the publication by K. Sun et al. in Nat. Commun 13, 4943 (2022):  
[scRNA-seq of gastric tumor shows complex intercellular interaction with an alternative T cell exhaustion trajectory]( https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32627-z) Information for sample collection, processing, and library preparation can be accessed through the linked paper in the Methods section.
