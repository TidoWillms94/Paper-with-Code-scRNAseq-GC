scRNAseq Analyse for Gastric Cancer
# Data avalibility
Singel cell sequencing data was optained aceess through the Genome Sequencing Archive from the China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB) under the acession number [HRA000704](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa-human/browse/HRA000704). The sequencing data was made public through the puplication from K. Sun et al. in Nat. Commun 13, 4943, (2022) [scRNA-seq of gastric tumor shows complex intercellular interaction with an alternative T cell exhaustion trajectory]( https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32627-z)
